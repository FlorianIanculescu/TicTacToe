# TicTacToe

This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game developed using JavaFX. Tic-Tac-Toe game is a simple two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. The game starts with an empty grid and players take turns placing their mark (either X or O) on the grid until one player succeeds in placing three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal. The game then ends and the winning player is declared. The game can also end in a tie if all the spaces on the grid are filled and no player has won.
